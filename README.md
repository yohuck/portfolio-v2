# Eric Lake Portfolio
This is my currently-under-construction web development portfolio. Feel free to check out the current live site at https://www.ericallenlake.com/

## Technology Used
This prortfolio is built using Svelte + Vite, then deployed on Vercel. I built all-custom CSS and utilize various modern CSS concepts like keyframes (contact form animation), SVG manipulation, and custom properties. The Svelte implementation utililizes stores in Svelte to pass state between components.

In-process I am building a gallery using Svelte to dynamically create each project section and the JavaScript data visualization library D3 along with the GitHub API to display my commit history and other statistics.
